        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In commemoration of the Fourth Anniversary of the Foundation</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">More than Four years have passed since the creation of Tamkine Foundation; We celebrate by committing ourselves to</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;quadruple&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have achieved so much in such a short period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday’s question was: is this project feasible? We never stopped doubting, wondering as well about the relevance of the concept itself, the digital tools that we proposed to develop for its implementation as for the expected impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today and after four years of struggle, hard work, questioning, confidence in the relevance of our approach, the efforts we have devoted to its implementation, and the results that we have generated speak of themselves. We were right to trust our ingenuity, reason to adopt an Innovative and Creative approach to Information and Communication Technologies in the education act: Our results are the best indicator; we are on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today more than ever, we must continue, we must develop and strengthen the implementation of our programs through this Innovative and Creative use of Information and Communication Technologies in educating the young generation.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Tamkine Tutoring, Tamkine Excellence, the other programs we created and implemented during the last&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">four&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">years, and recently, Tamkine Academy, which has already given rise to Tamkine Seminars, and Tamkine Workplace, are but a few milestones of this great dream, the advent of which we have all got down to.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">More than ever before, our country needs our&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">initiative</span><span lang="EN-US">, our resolve, our commitment, our determination and our ingenuity paid off when the situation was normal. Nowadays, this is the challenge that we will take up and will succeed in achieving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are inspired by the Royal orientations in matters of Education and Training, by the Declaration of His Majesty making Education the Second National Priority after Territorial Integrity; by His Majesty’s determination to provide the country with the competences and profiles&nbsp; required to ensure its economic and social development.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Our actions on the&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">field</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;are but an active implementation of the principles dear</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">to His Majesty, which the Sovereign emphasized in his declaration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say it today with confidence, this confinement due to the pandemic is an opportunity that drives us to give the best of ourselves in order to succeed in the transformation of our education system initiated by the public authorities in charge of the sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We dedicate our work to His Majesty King Mohamed VI may God assist him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reiterate and confirm our commitment and our determination to make our contribution to the qualitative improvement of education undertaken by the heads of the Department of Education, and at their head Doctor Saaid Amzazi, Minister of National Education, Vocational Training, Higher Education and Scientific Research, to those who have always trusted us and have given us their support; teachers, inspectors, students, parents, as well as the whole educational administration&nbsp; system and the greater Tamkine community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">sincere thanks to our partners, active throughout the country, we share with you today our determination, as a Citizen Foundation, our commitment and our resolution to make our active contribution to the qualitative improvement of education in our country.</span></p>
